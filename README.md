# IEEE SoutheastCon 2024 Software Competition: Beach Forecast Device

This repository contains the project documentation and prototype for the Beach Forecast Device developed by Abdala Jabase, Brian Luckett, and Adam Moore from Christian Brothers University for the IEEE SoutheastCon 2024 Software Competition.

## Theoretical Project Description

The Beach Forecast Device is designed to monitor various parameters of a beach environment, including tide and wave height, water temperature, UV intensity, air temperature, humidity, and the status of the beach warning flag. Data collection is facilitated by a network of monitoring stations, allowing beachgoers to access real-time information remotely. The device aims to enhance safety for beach visitors by providing accurate and timely forecasts and contributing to ocean and environmental research efforts.

## Prototype Description

The prototype demonstrates key features of the Beach Forecast Device using sensors such as Temperature/Humidity, IR, Light, Water Level, and a DC motor. The prototype simulates data collection and transmission, as well as the display of information on an LCD screen. Although the prototype may not fully represent the final product, it showcases the core functionalities and potential applications of the device.
